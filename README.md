WeatherApp:
This is a Weather Application that I built using React and Vite as a frontend mini-project.  
The main goal of this project was to practice React concepts and understand how to deploy a React app as a live website.

Live Website

About the Project
I created this project to improve my understanding of:
- React component structure
- Using modern build tools like Vite
- Hosting a frontend project using GitHub Pages

The application provides weather-related information for a given location with a clean and responsive user interface.
but the weather may differ from the real weather. 
⚠️ Important Note About Weather Data
The temperature and weather details shown in this application may **slightly differ from real-time or local measurements**.  
This is because the data is fetched from an external weather API and depends on:
- API data update intervals
- City-level weather approximation
- Network latency
-
